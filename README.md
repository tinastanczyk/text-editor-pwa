  ## Description
  The motivation for this project is to create a notes app that works on or offline. This app uses the WebpackPwaManifest package to create a manifest.json file, babel to translate from ES6, workbox and serviceworker, and indexedDB. I learned how to use all of these packages in order to create a Progressive Web Application that can be installed through your browser.
